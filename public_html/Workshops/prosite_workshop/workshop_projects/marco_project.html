   <P>
Here below are the criteria of acceptation/rejection of the matches by
motif descriptor as used to produce the InterPro hit list:</P>
<P>Prosite Profiles - Only matches with score exceeding the so-called
   LEVEL=0 cutoff are accepted. The fact that a protein has multiple
   matches by a domain is not considered.</P>
 <P>
Pfam HMMs - The computation that produces the decision to accept
   match(es) of a motif on a protein is quite intricate. The raw score of
   every match and the sum of the score of individual matches are first
   re-evaluated by the search program to take into account the
   composition of the matched protein (this step can be skipped with the
   --null2 option). Then, the acceptation of matches rely upon the TWO
   cutoffs declared on the GA line of every Pfam entry: the first one is
   for sum of all matches (the per protein cumulated score), the second
   one is for the highest scoring individual match (the per match
   score). According to the HMMER2.0 manual, the cutoff is set by default
   to zero for the acceptation of the remaining individualmatchs...but
   the actual behaviour of hmmsearch might be different!</P>

<P>The Pfam startegy is clearly advantageous for the detection of domains
that usually occur reapeated in a protein. The goal of this workshop
is to write the specifications (part of the user manual) of a new type
of Prosite rules, that would permit to improve the detection multiple
domains in a protein. There are three points to work out</P>

   - The envisaged modification to the Prosite format.<BR>
   - The stategy used to combine the matches.<BR>
   - Extensive case studies to evaluate the appropriateness of the
     envisaged startegy.<BR>

<P>The following miscellaneous points might fuel the debate:</P>

<P>   The Pfam stategy is actually problematic on one point. "Scanning"
   or "searching" several proteins with several HMMs may result in
   different list of matches. This is basically an implementation
   problem, but new rules that suffer from this kind of ambiguities
   have to be rejected.
</P>
<P>   Another weekness of the Pfam strategy is that it can only deal with
   multiple occurences of the same motif. A domain described by two
   sub-domains would strongly benefit from a co-evaluation of the scores.</P>

<P>   It must be stressed that all these considerations are
   "proteinocentric". The concept of multiple matches on a DNA sequence is
   not very relevant because of the size of the molecules which is
   usually quite arbitrarilly fixed in databases. The "proximity" of two
   matches should be taken into account.
