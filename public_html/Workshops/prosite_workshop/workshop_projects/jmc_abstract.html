<H1>Beyond the limit of the traditional ("bourgeois") domain shuffling
view: some alternative ("situationist") protein evolution models</H1>
<h2>Jean-Michel Claverie,IGS </h2>

<P>Situationism began in the late nineteen
fifties as a Surrealist inspired attack on the mechanism of alienated
consumption and the vulgar values of The Society of the Spectacle, the
title of a work by Guy Debord, where much of the Situationist ideas are
conveyed. The Situationists critiqued the idea of work, play, the media,
all organisation, all hierarchy, and the traditional Left, emphasizing
spontaneous self-expression, sexual liberation, the necessity for
creativity and the exaltation of imagination and desire. Just as the
spectacle must change all the time, to give the illusion of motion, so too
must Situationism, to be able to challenge its domination.

<P>
Just as the traditional view of protein evolution give the illusion of
change, alternative models are necessary to account for real protein
creativity.
