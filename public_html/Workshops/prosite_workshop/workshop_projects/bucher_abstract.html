<h1>Good profiles and what they are good for.</h1> 

<h2>Philipp Bucher</h2>

<p>Sequence family based similarity search methods such as profiles
are claimed to be more effective in detecting distant homologies
between proteins than single-query based methods such as the
Smith-Waterman algorithm. This claim is supported by benchmarks.
I'm hypothesizing that profiles may outperform pairwise methods
also with regard to other criteria such as (i) reliable subfamily
classification, (ii) accurate domain delineation, and (iii) generation
of better alignments for homology-based 3D structure modeling.
This has not yet been demonstrated to be true, corresponding
benchmarking protocols first need to be developed. I'm further
arguing that sensitivity and the other above mentioned
performance criteria are conflicting objectives and that different 
profiles for the same protein family should be used for gene discovery, 
automatic sequence annotation, and homology-based 3D structure
modeling, respectively.</p>
