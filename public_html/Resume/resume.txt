Teaching Experience 
Embnet Courses of Sequence Analysis 
 
-September 1998, Lausanne, Switzerland (Course organized by ISREC and the Ludwig Institute). 
-September 1999, Lausanne, Switzerland (Course organized by ISREC and the Ludwig Institute).

University Courses 

-The theory of multiple sequence alignments. 
-Practical work on multiple sequence alignments. 
 
All these courses have been provided along with practicals. They were mostly based on the GCG environment. My main contribution has been a series of tutorial on sequence analysis with a special emphasis on multiple sequence alignments. 

Research Experience  
September 1999... 
Assistant Professor in Bioinformatics at Marseilles University. Research at the IGS in the group of Jean Michel Claverie. 

November 1998-September 1999 
Post Doc with Jaap Heringa and Willie Taylor in the department of Mathematical Biology of the MRC in Mill Hill. 

June 1998- November 1998 
Visit of Philip Bucher at ISREC (Institut Suisse de Recherche et d'Experimentation Sur le Cancer). This short stay gave me a chance to be initiated to the concept of HMMs, Profiles and Probabilistic techniques thanks to the strong expertise of the group in this field.
September 1996-April 1998 
Joined Thure Etzold group at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Development of new projects integrated in an SRS framework. This gave me a chance to be introduced to the main concepts of SRS the Sequence Retrieval System.
July 1994-September 1996 
Joined Des Higgins group at the EBI in Hinxton (U.K.). Detailed introduction to the main techniques involved in sequence analysis, and more specifically in multiple sequence analysis. Building of contacts in the sequence analysis community. Development of new algorithms, Genetic Algorithms based, for improved analysis. This includes the programs SAGA and RAGA. 

March 1994-July 1994 
Joined the Data Library at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg (Germany). Initiation to the general techniques of Bioinformatics. 

December 1992-October 1993 
Joined the group of Prof F. Amalric at the 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire des Eucaryotes' in Toulouse. wet lab work. Analyse of the interaction between a protein (Nucleolin) and a fragment of ribosomal RNA. Development of a software for analyzing the output of some wet lab techniques based on the SELEX method (finding consensus among small nucleotide sequences). On the bases of this work, allocation of a PhD grant from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory.
