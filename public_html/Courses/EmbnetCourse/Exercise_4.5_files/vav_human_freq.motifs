* N-glycosylation site *
************************

It has been known for a long time [1] that potential N-glycosylation sites are
specific to the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr.  It must be noted that the
presence of the consensus  tripeptide  is  not sufficient  to conclude that an
asparagine residue is glycosylated, due to  the fact that the  folding of  the
protein plays an important  role in the  regulation of N-glycosylation [2]. It
has been shown [3] that  the  presence of proline between Asn and Ser/Thr will
inhibit N-glycosylation; this  has  been confirmed by a recent [4] statistical
analysis of glycosylation sites, which also  shows that about 50% of the sites
that have a proline C-terminal to Ser/Thr are not glycosylated.

It must also  be noted that there  are  a few  reported cases of glycosylation
sites with the pattern Asn-Xaa-Cys; an  experimentally demonstrated occurrence
of such a non-standard site is found in the plasma protein C [5].

****************************************************************

There has been a  number of studies  relative to the  specificity of cAMP- and
cGMP-dependent protein kinases [1,2,3].  Both types of kinases appear to share
a preference  for  the  phosphorylation  of serine or threonine residues found
close to at least  two consecutive N-terminal  basic residues. It is important
to note that there are quite a number of exceptions to this rule.

* Casein kinase II phosphorylation site *
*****************************************

Casein kinase II (CK-2) is a protein serine/threonine kinase whose activity is
independent of  cyclic  nucleotides   and  calcium.  CK-2  phosphorylates many
different proteins.   The  substrate  specificity [1]  of  this  enzyme can be
summarized as follows:

 (1) Under comparable conditions Ser is favored over Thr.
 (2) An acidic residue (either Asp or Glu) must be present three residues from
     the C-terminal of the phosphate acceptor site.
 (3) Additional acidic  residues in  positions +1, +2, +4, and +5 increase the
     phosphorylation rate.  Most  physiological  substrates  have at least one
     acidic residue in these positions.
 (4) Asp is preferred to Glu as the provider of acidic determinants.
 (5) A basic residue at the N-terminal  of the  acceptor  site  decreases  the
     phosphorylation rate, while an acidic one will increase it.

**************************************************
* Phorbol esters / diacylglycerol binding domain *
**************************************************

Diacylglycerol (DAG) is an important second messenger. Phorbol esters (PE) are
analogues of   DAG  and  potent  tumor  promoters  that  cause  a  variety  of
physiological  changes when  administered  to  both  cells  and  tissues.  DAG
activates a  family of serine/threonine protein kinases, collectively known as
protein  kinase C (PKC) [1]. Phorbol esters can directly stimulate PKC. The N-
terminal region of PKC, known as C1, has  been shown [2] to bind PE and DAG in
a phospholipid and zinc-dependent fashion.  The C1 region contains one  or two
copies (depending  on  the isozyme of PKC)  of a cysteine-rich domain about 50
amino-acid residues  long and essential for DAG/PE-binding.  Such a domain has
also been found in the following proteins:

 - Diacylglycerol kinase  (EC 2.7.1.107)  (DGK)  [3], the enzyme that converts
   DAG into  phosphatidate.  It  contains  two  copies  of  the DAG/PE-binding
   domain in its N-terminal section.  At least five different forms of DGK are
   known in mammals.
 - N-chimaerin.  A  brain  specific  protein which shows sequence similarities
   with the  BCR  protein at its C-terminal part and contains a single copy of
   the DAG/PE-binding  domain  at its N-terminal part. It has been shown [4,5]
   to be able to bind phorbol esters.
 - The  raf/mil  family  of  serine/threonine  protein  kinases. These protein
   kinases contain a single N-terminal copy of the DAG/PE-binding domain.
 - The  unc-13  protein from Caenorhabditis elegans. Its function is not known
   but it  contains a copy of the DAG/PE-binding domain in its central section
   and has  been shown to bind specifically to a phorbol ester in the presence
   of calcium [6].
 - The vav oncogene.  Vav was generated by a genetic rearrangement during gene
   transfer  assays.  Its  expression  seems  to be  restricted  to  cells  of
   hematopoeitic origin. Vav seems [5,7] to contain a DAG/PE-binding domain in
   the central part of the protein.
 - The Drosophila GTPase activating protein rotund.

The DAG/PE-binding domain binds two zinc ions; the ligands of these metal ions
are probably the six  cysteines  and two histidines that are conserved in this
domain. We have developed a signature pattern that spans completely the DAG/PE
domain.

**********************************************************************
* Guanine-nucleotide dissociation stimulators CDC24 family signature *
**********************************************************************

Ras proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that  bind GTP and GDP
and  slowly  hydrolyze  GTP to GDP [1].  The  balance  between  the  GTP bound
(active) and GDP bound (inactive) states  is regulated  by the opposite action
of proteins activating the GTPase activity and that of  proteins which promote
the loss of bound GDP and the uptake of fresh GTP [2,3].  The latter  proteins
are known  as  guanine-nucleotide dissociation stimulators (GDSs)  (or also as
guanine-nucleotide releasing (or exchange) factors (GRFs)).  Proteins that act
as GDS can be classified  into at least two families, on the basis of sequence
similarities.  One of  these families is currently known to group the proteins
listed below   (references   are   only    provided  for  recently  determined
sequences):

 - CDC24 from yeast. CDC24 is a GDS that acts on the ras-like protein CDC42.
 - Dbl (or mcf-2) oncogene from mammals.  Dbl is a GDS for a  ras-like protein
   known as G25K or CDC42Hs.
 - p140-RAS GRF (cdc25Mm) from mammals. This protein, a GDS for ras, possesses
   both a domain belonging to the CDC24 family  and one belonging to the CDC25
   family.
 - Bcr oncogene from mammals. Bcr can form a chimera  with the abl protein and
   then cause   chronic  myelogenous  leukemia  (CML).  Bcr  acts  on  p21-rac
   proteins.
 - Oncogene vav from mammals. The target of this protein is not yet known.
 - Oncogene ect2 from mouse [4]. The target of this protein is not yet known.
 - scd1 from fission yeast.

The size of  these  proteins range from 736 residues (CDC42)  to 1271 residues
(bcr). The sequence  similarity shared  by  all these proteins is limited to a
region of  about  180  amino  acids,  generally located in their N-terminal or
central section.  As  a signature pattern, we selected the most conserved part
of this domain.

*************************
* N-myristoylation site *
*************************

An  appreciable  number of eukaryotic  proteins  are  acylated by the covalent
addition of myristate (a C14-saturated fatty acid) to their N-terminal residue
via an amide linkage [1,2]. The sequence specificity of the enzyme responsible
for this  modification,   myristoyl CoA:protein N-myristoyl transferase (NMT),
has been  derived from the sequence of known N-myristoylated proteins and from
studies using synthetic peptides. It seems to be the following:

 - The N-terminal residue must be glycine.
 - In position 2, uncharged residues  are allowed.  Charged residues,  proline
   and large hydrophobic residues are not allowed.
 - In positions 3 and 4, most, if not all, residues are allowed.
 - In position  5,  small uncharged  residues are allowed (Ala, Ser, Thr, Cys,
   Asn and Gly). Serine is favored.
 - In position 6, proline is not allowed.

-Consensus pattern: G-{EDRKHPFYW}-x(2)-[STAGCN]-{P}
                    [G is the N-myristoylation site]

-Note: we  deliberately include as  potential myristoylated  glycine residues,
 those which  are  internal  to a sequence. It could well be that the sequence
 under study  represents  a  viral  polyprotein  precursor and that subsequent
 proteolytic processing  could expose an internal glycine as the N-terminal of
 a mature protein.
