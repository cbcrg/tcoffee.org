1-Introduction
This testcase was generated using a Calcium Dependant Protein Kinase
(Q06850). 
Q06850 contains (Nter ->Cter):
	kinase domain (300 AA) that includes:
		-Nuc Binding site
		-Calalytic site
	4 EF-Hands in tandem

Q06850 was used to identify other members of the family (master.aln).
Sequences were multiply aligned and the blocks were swapped:

	Kinase-EFI-EFII-EFIII-EFIV -> EFII-EFI-EFIV-EFIII-KINASE

That new multiple alignment was used with seq_generator (Cedric Notredame)
to generate 20 random sequences having the same prosite signatures. Using
the Prosite documentation, Calcium BS, Nuc BS and active sites were
selectively inactivated.
	List Of  Active sites:

	 26- EF-Hand D (->K to inactivate)
	 61- EF Hand D (->K to inactivate)
	 96- EF Hand D (->K to inactivate)
	132- EF Hand D (->K to inactivate)
        188- Kinase  K (->D to inactivate) Nuc Binding
        294- Kinase  D (->K to inactivate) Active Site
2-names
Generated Sequences Receive a name that indicates the state of each site:
	zxxxxx

	if x>0 the corresponding site is active
	if x=0 the site is NOT active

3-Possible use
	-Blast vs SwissProt
	-lalign
	-multiple alignment of the EF repeats
	-multiple alignment (domain/domain)	
	-Sec Structure prediction (domain/bomain)
	-Structure prediction (Blast Vs PDB gives enough hits)

	-Phylogeny: NO
